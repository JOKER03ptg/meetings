# SuperTux Internal Storyline Meeting Notes

August 27, 2017

- RustyBox will design a story for Antarctica and will implement this in cutscenes and levels that use visual information for story telling (kind of like visual novels)
- Clarification: That story needs to be logically coherent
- Tux will cross a smaller part of the ocean from Antarctica to Crystal Mine Island using the existing Icefloes. RustyBox will work on adding this as a cutscene. Some icefloe tiles might make sense for the worldmap.
- After the mine, Tux finds an old, broken boat. Using collectable hidden items from the mine, Tux repairs the boat in some cutscene (if all items have been found) and continues to Forest Island. @mteufel:matrix.org will work on the code for this, the Crystal Mine level will be tweaked to include some items in hidden areas and a cutscene will be made by someone from the level design team.
- Tux arrives on Forest Island. At some point the Granitos will get involved in the story. Tux will go to the Ghost Forest, with Ghost Tree as boss. After defeating Ghost Tree, the worldmap turns normal as long as Tux is outside of the Ghost Forest
- Open stays the way Tux gets to the next island, if so
- Alternate Level Exits will be implemented for use in Forest levels
- RustyBox will work on adding a proper, full detailed story to the Forest Island levels. Additionally, vns will propose new features to be integrated into the story and then added so they can be used in levels.
